# Search Relevance Repository 🔍

I created this repository to explore various search relevance techniques by developing tutorials 🏗️, creating Hugging Face 🤗 spaces and demos, and compiling useful resources 📚.

### List of tutorials 📖
- [`Quora Similar Questions Finder`](https://yalaa-quora-similar-questions.hf.space): Hugging Face 🤗 Space: This is a demonstration of how to construct a vector index database with Qdrant using questions from Quora. It then employs semantic search to identify the top K questions most similar to the user's input.
