    "    By inputing queries or questions, this space leverages machine learning to surface the most relevant Wikipedia passages and articles, providing insights and answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Features\n",
    "    - **Dataset**: This program sifts through Simple Wikipedia data, creating a comprehensive semantic search platform that covers a broad spectrum of information.\n",
    "    - **Indexing**: Utilizes an index vector database on `Qdrant` cloud, constructed from {} Wikipedia passages, for quick and efficient retrieval.\n",
    "    - **NLP Models**: \n",
    "      - **Bi-Encoder**: Employs the pretrained encoder [`multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1) from Sentence Transformers to retrieve the top K relevant passages.\n",
    "      - **Cross-Encoder Reranking**: Further refines search results using the [`cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2`](https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2?text=I+like+you.+I+love+you) model to rerank the passages, ensuring the delivery of contextually relevant information.\n",
    "    - **Discovery**: Showcases the most relevant passage alongside the top article before and after reranking, with the relevant passage highlighted for ease of understanding. Additionally, displays the article titles of the top K results before and after reranking, offering a comprehensive view of your search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## How to Use\n",
    "    1. **Enter a Query or Question**: Start by typing your query or question into the system.\n",
    "    2. **Select K Value (2-30)**: Choose the number of results you wish to retrieve.\n",
    "    3. **Discover Relevant Information**: The system then processes your input using both bi-encoder and cross-encoder techniques to first fetch and then rerank the passages. The most relevant Wikipedia passages and articles, before and after reranking, are presented, highlighting the progress of relevance through the process.\n",
